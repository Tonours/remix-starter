## Development

From your terminal:

```sh
yarn run dev
```

This starts your app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes.

## Deployment

First, build your app for production:

```sh
yarn run build
```

Then run the app in production mode:

```sh
yarn start
```

Now you'll need to pick a host to deploy it to.

## Lint

Lint your code with:

```sh
yarn run lint
```

## Test

Run your tests with:

```sh
yarn run test
```

## Storybook

Run your storybook with:

```sh
yarn run storybook
```

## Hygen: Create a new UI Component

Scaffold a new UI component (component, stories and test) with:

```sh
yarn run component:new
```

### DIY

If you're familiar with deploying node applications, the built-in Remix app server is production-ready.

Make sure to deploy the output of `remix build`

- `build/`
- `public/build/`
